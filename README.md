Hall-of-Fame-Discord.js-Bot

A hall of fame bot that allows you save text, images, and audio. To create quotes you must first create authors, which have an image and name. Quotes can have up to 3 tags. Regular quotes must have an author, and text or an image. Or both! Audio quotes must have an audio/video file and a title. You can upload a file to Discord, copy the link, and use that. You can also use the last_attachment parameter to just use the most recent file sent in a channel. Use /help for more information.
